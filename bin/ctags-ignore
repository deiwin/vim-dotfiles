# This passes the last argument (the path) to Ag, while passing other flags and
# options to ctags. This allows the command to leverage Ag's ability to ignore
# files/folders specified in .gitignore and .agignore files.

# listing multiple files/folders as ctags does. But it should be enough for
# usage with vim-gutentags.
